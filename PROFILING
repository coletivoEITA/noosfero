Introduction
============
Noosfero supports newrelic_rpm, fiveruns_tuneup and rails performance testing for profiling

Configuration
=============
Edit config/database.yml and config/solr.yml to create the `profiling` environment.
Replace the development definition to:
    development: &DEVELOPMENT

And add the profiling environment:
    profiling:
      <<: *DEVELOPMENT

Setup
=====
Install profile tools:
    gem install fiveruns_tuneup
    gem install newrelic_rpm

To use newrelic_rpm and fiveruns_tuneup run the webserver using the 'profiling' environment:
    script/server thin -e profiling

NOTE: newrelic_rpm is incompatible with fiveruns_tuneup enabled. Disable the latter to use the former.
(See config/environment.rb and config/environments/profiling.rb)

Use
===
fiveruns_tuneup will show up in the top of every page.
newrelic_rpm reports are accessible at '/newrelic'

To run a performance test use:
     RAILS_ENV=profiling script/performance/profiler test/performance/script.rb
